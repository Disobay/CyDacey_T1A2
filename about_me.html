                <p class="pp1">My name is Cy Cleveland Dacey, I am 18 years old as of March this year and I was born on the Gold Coast.
                As far as my personality goes I would say I am the type of person to have no filter, and I believe that the most important
                attribute in a person is their humor. My interests consist of going to the gym at least 4 times a week and gaming with my friends.
                Through study and physical experience i have gathered skills such as marketing, engineering and gymnastics at level 9 but I had to retire
                due to a back injury in 2019.</p>
